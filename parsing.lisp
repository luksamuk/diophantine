Diophantine equations are indeed EQUATIONS, therefore we need to SPLIT them into
two formulas and parse each one of them!
Example:
 
                          w^3 + 2x^3 = 3y^3 + 4z^3

                              can be stored as

                          ( ( (1 . 3) (2 . 3) )
                            ( (3 . 3) (4 . 3) ) )

- List of exactly two lists
- Each sublist contains pairs (coefficient . power)
- Position of lists imply position around the = sign

It would seem like we could actually make minor changes to the current code in
order to make it create each list at the end, and then we just create a
super-function two split the equation in two and do what is needed. In the end,
just join the two lists as elements of another list.
